Collection of common sass mixins to create cross browser css3 rules.

## aim
CSS3 brings web style rules to the next level with border radius, background gradients, box and text shadows, transformations and even animations. The downside is that it's not (yet) supported by every browser and each browser often has its own notation. Writing the style rules for each browser is tedious. Enter [SASS](http://lhttp://sass-lang.com/): extending CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions. Using SASS we can create smart code blocks unifying the style notation and letting the CSS be generated automatically. 

## contents
This collection provides a set of reusable SASS code blocks for common CSS3 styles such as opacity, rgba & gradient backgrounds, rounded corners, box & text shadows, transformations, animations and other common mixins. Some of the original cross browser CSS rules are inspired by [CSS3, please](http://css3please.com/) and some of the SASS code blocks are borrowed from [Web Design Weekly](http://web-design-weekly.com/2013/05/12/handy-sass-mixins/).
